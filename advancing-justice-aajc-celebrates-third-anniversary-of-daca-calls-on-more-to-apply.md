President Obama’s DACA program has saved the lives of many immigrants,
including Asian American and Pacific Islanders, who have benefited from
not only receiving deportation relief and the ability to obtain work
authorization but in some cases also obtain a drivers’ license as well
as to access health care, open a bank account and receive in-state
college tuition.
